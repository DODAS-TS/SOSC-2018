## What is Spark?

Apache Spark is an open-source powerful distributed querying and processing engine.

Apache Spark allows the user to read, transform, and aggregate data and its APIs are accessible
in Java, Scala, Python, R and SQL.

Apache Spark exposes a host of libraries familiar to data analysts.

Further more, it can easily run locally on a laptop, deployed in
standalone mode, over YARN, or Apache Mesos - either on your local cluster or
in the cloud.
