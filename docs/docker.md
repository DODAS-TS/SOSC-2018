## Virtual machines and Docker containers

### Virtual machine

Virtual machines have a full OS with its own memory management installed with the associated overhead of virtual device drivers. In a virtual machine, valuable resources are emulated for the guest OS and hypervisor, which makes it possible to run many instances of one or more operating systems in parallel on a single machine (or host). Every guest OS runs as an individual entity from the host system.

### Docker containers

On the other hand Docker containers are executed with the Docker engine rather than the hypervisor. Containers are therefore smaller than Virtual Machines and enable faster start up with better performance, less isolation and greater compatibility possible due to sharing of the hostâ€™s kernel.

## Deploy services whitin container

For Docker installation and fundamentals you can visit [this page](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). For time reason it has already been installed on DEMO machines.

### Deploy a webserver

We can deploy a webserver within a container with the following command. Please notice that inside the container the port used is the standard one (80), but with the option -p one can map that port to one of choice on the host system.

``` bash
sudo docker run -dit --name my-apache-app -p 4880:80 httpd:2.4
```

To use a configured index.html it is enough to mount the namespace of the local host inside the container at a specified path (see [here](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)):

``` bash
sudo docker run -dit --name my-apache-app -p 4880:80 -v "$PWD":/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4
```

In both cases the home webpage should appear on `localhost:4880`.

__N.B.(2/2) a public repository for any container that want to be shared are collected into "registries", the Docker official one is [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com)__
